## Mechanics
As you start to play, the snake is of a small size. But, witch each pellet it eats, its size increases in length. 
The goal of Snake is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding into the walls, or yourself (when you're too big to move).

## Controls
This game uses the arrow keys on the keyboard to function.



Happy gaming! :)
